Tutorials taken from http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming and converted to the Go language.
GLFW ( https://github.com/jteeuwen/glfw ) is used for OpenGL 3.3 context creation.
A custom OpenGL Go binding ( https://github.com/Agon/Go-OpenGL ) is used.

I am slowly converting the examples to a different OpenGL Go binding which implements the API directly and completly.
New binding is located here: https://github.com/chsc/gogl/
